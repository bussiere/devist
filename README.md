# devist!

A Ruby library to create beautiful release notes.

## How do I devist?

Let's pretend you are a developer having typical `RELEASES.md`, `NEWS.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` in your project repository. 
Using **devist**, you can generate and export these notes to `.html` and allow users to check them out without reading 
 ugly markdown format.
 
```
$ devist
       __          _      __ 
  ____/ /__ _   __(_)____/ /_
 / __  / _ \ | / / / ___/ __/
/ /_/ /  __/ |/ / (__  ) /_  
\__,_/\___/|___/_/____/\__/
